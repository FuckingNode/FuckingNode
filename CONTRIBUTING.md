# Contributing

These are basic guidelines & info we hope you'll find useful for contributing to the project. For installer-script-related or documentation-related contributions, head to [this repository instead](https://github.com/FuckingNode/fuckingnode.github.io).

## Dev tools

1. Install [Deno (latest version)](https://deno.com) if you haven't. ~~Your welcome for not choosing that one JS runtime that we're trying to fix and that would fill up your disk with `node_modules/`~~.
2. Make a fork of the repo and clone it locally. You'll work from the default `master` branch.
3. Start writing code :smile:.
4. To test, run with `deno -A src/main.ts <args>` (e.g. `deno -A src/main.ts clean -- --verbose`).

## Making good contributions

You already know how this works.

1. Test your code before making a PR so nothing breaks.
2. Update the CHANGELOG to reflect what you did in a meaningful way.
3. If you add new functions, types, whatsoever, don't forget to use JSDoc so we all know what they do.
4. Ensure everything that can be typed is typed.

Additionally, these are some good coding practices we recommend for this (and any project):

### Avoid nesting

Look at this mess (it's an example):

```ts
async function StartUp() {
    if (User.isAuthenticated) {
        if (User.isAdmin) {
            await handle_startup().then(async () => {
                await login("admin");
            });
        } else {
            await handle_startup().then(async () => {
                await login("user");
            });
        }
    } else {
        throw new Error("User ain't authenticated!");
    }
}
```

We could avoid nesting using `if` the smart ðŸ—¿ way:

```ts
async function StartUp() {
    if (!User.isAuthenticated) throw new Error("User ain't authenticated!");
    await startup();
    if (User.isAdmin) {
        await login("admin");
    } else {
        await login("user");
    }
}
```

We can avoid even another level by using ternary operators:

```ts
async function StartUp() {
    if (!User.isAuthenticated) throw new Error("User ain't authenticated!");
    await startup();
    await login(User.isAdmin ? "admin" : "user");
}
```

Got the idea? Use any method you can think of to ensure your code can be read like a normal text, with the least nesting possible.

### Know where to `switch` and where to `if`

Both statements do the same with one difference: `switch`es are more readable, `if`s are nested one level less. So, which one do we recommend?

The answer is simple: both, depending on (1) the amount of cases that can appear and (2) what makes more sense to use.

Places where _not too many_ cases are possible and/or an `else`/`default` statement would be used, should use `if else` directives, while cases where A LOT of options are possible and/or there isn't a "default" one, should use `switch`.

> Other than that, as long as your code doesn't suck, anything will do.

Thank you so much for contributing. Happy coding!
