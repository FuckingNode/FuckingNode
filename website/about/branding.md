# F*ckingNode branding guidelines

Just in case you wanted to write an article or make a video about us ;) (thank you!). We're not Nintendo, of course we won't sue you if you don't follow this _rules_ whatsoever. They're here just in case you don't know how to represent the branding of a logo-less project (a logo is WIP btw :eyes:) or simply wanted to ensure you stick to our ideals (thank you for that too).

## No logo - Can I use another symbol?

Please don't. Don't use our name together with the NodeJS logo or any logo / symbol you find related. Use text and the name to represent us.

## How to style the name then?

Ideally, capitalize it as FuckingNode. The asterisk (F*ckingNode) is optional. If used, censor the U and not any other letter (~~Fu\*kingNode~~).

There isn't any preference towards font families to be used. We recommend a `monospace` font.

## Can acronyms or abbreviations be used

They are all discouraged. If you're really going to use an acronym in a case where it's objectively better, only abbreviation accepted is `FkNode`. Neither `FNode` nor `FN` nor `FkngNode`.

## Colors?

We don't really have any rule. We personally thinks fitting colors would be either **green** (reference to "Node"), or **orange** (reference to "F\*cking"). This page was initially using orange as it's accent color, by the way. We changed to white simply for the looks, it doesn't represent anything.
