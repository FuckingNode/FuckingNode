# Roadmap

What we're planning to do. Only includes minor and major releases, patch releases only fix bugs, thus they aren't planned (as our plan and hope is to write errorless code (which we'll never do, but we'll try our best to get as close as possible to that)).

We'll expand (and rarely, but not impossibly, shrink) this roadmap as we make progress and/or change our plans.

## Version 2.1

- [ ] Release the `audit` feature (as an experiment (`npm` only)). Learn more [here](../learn/audit.md).
- [ ] Support more IDEs for the `kickstart` command (PS. doing this is as simple as ensuring we know the command to launch that editor in all platforms).
- [ ] Get this documentation finished.

## Version 2.2

- [ ] Per-project cleanup.
- [ ] Flagless features via `fknode.yaml`.

## Version 3.0

- [ ] Make a proper logo for the project.
- [ ] G`REDACTED`
