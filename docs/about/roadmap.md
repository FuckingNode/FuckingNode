# Roadmap

What we're planning to do. Only includes minor and major releases, patch releases only fix bugs, thus they aren't planned (as our plan and hope is to write errorless code (which we'll never do, but we'll try our best to get as close as possible to that)).

We'll expand (and rarely, but not impossibly, shrink) this roadmap as we make progress and/or change our plans.

## 2.X

### Version 2.2

- [X] Per-project cleanup.
- [X] Flagless features via `fknode.yaml`.
- [ ] Auto-flush for log files.

----

### Version 2.1 (Released)

- [X] Release the `audit` feature as an `npm` only experiment. Learn more [here](../learn/audit.md).
- [X] Support more editors for the `kickstart` command (PS. doing this is as simple as ensuring we know the command to launch that editor in all platforms).
    - [X] Emacs
    - [X] Notepad ++
    - [X] VSCodium
    - [X] Atom (_it's unmaintained, but anyways..._)
- [X] Get this documentation finished.

## 3.X

### Version 3.0

- [ ] Make a proper logo for the project.
- [ ] Better installer
    - [ ] Revamped `.ps1` based installer for Windows.
    - [ ] New `.sh` based installed for mac and Linux.
- [ ] Cross-runtime migration.

- [ ] Better error handling.
- [ ] G`REDACTED`
