# Stats command

This is the simplest thing ever. Just run `fuckingnode stats *`, replacing `*` with the name of a project (from the `package.json`'s `"name"` field) or the path to the project's root, and something like this will be shown to you (using CLI colors and stuff):

```txt
personaplus@0.0.6-preapp.27 C:\Users\Zaka\personaplus
node runtime & npm pkg manager
Main file: [object Object]

Depends on 37 m*therf*ckers:
@expo/vector-icons@^14.0.3
@react-native-picker/picker@2.9.0
@react-navigation/native@^7.0.0
expo@~52.0.20
... (when really using the command, all dependencies are shown)
```

We are thinking of a valid use case that we can give to this command. Until now, it's honestly useless.
