**On this website you'll find all you need to know about how to use this CLI.**

## Features

- [x] automated cleanup of JS projects
- [x] automated cleanup of global caches (especially useful for pnpm or Bun, where a single global cache exists)
- [x] automated updates of JS projects
- [x] automated linting of JS projects
- [x] automated prettying of JS projects
- [x] automated removal of unneeded files (e.g. dist/, out/...)
- [x] automated commit of lint / prettify / update changes in your code

\- **from a single command.** It's not magic, it's _F\*ckingNode_â€”and that name is shipping to production.

Plus other features like:

- [x] automated npm / jsr package release process, by running all code maintenance tasks, creating a git tag, committing all changes, bumping version from package file, and publishing to npm / jsr; from a single command
- [x] automated kickstart of a project, by cloning a repo, installing dependencies, and opening of your favorite editor; from a single command
- [x] automated migration from one package manager to another (e.g. npm -> pnpm) and dependency installation, from a single command
- [x] for "storage emergencies", automated removal of entire `node_modules` across all of your projects (you guessed it, from a single command)

And that's it for now.
