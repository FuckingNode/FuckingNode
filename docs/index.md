# The f*cking chaos ends here

We can't fix your bugs, but we can:

- help you recover disk space
- help you keep your 69 side-projects and their 420 dependencies up-to-date
- help you prettify your code so it doesn't suck
- help you remove those built executables abandoned in your `/out` directory for ages

\- **from a single command.** It's not magic, it's _F\*ckingNode_â€”and that name is shipping to production.

On this website you'll find all you need to know about how to use this CLI.

## Features

From a single command:

- [x] automated cleanup of NodeJS projects
- [x] automated cleanup of global caches (especially useful for `pnpm`, where a single global cache exists)
- [x] automated updates of NodeJS projects
- [x] automated linting of NodeJS projects
- [x] automated prettying of NodeJS projects
- [x] automated removal of unneeded files (e.g. dist/, out/...)
- [x] automated commit of lint / prettify / update changes in your code

Plus other features like:

- [x] automated migration from one package manager to another (e.g. npm -> pnpm) and dependency installation, from a single command
- [x] automated cloning of a repo, dependency installation, and opening of your favorite editor, from a single command
- [x] for "storage emergencies", automated removal of entire `node_modules` across all of your projects (you guessed it, from a single command)

And that's it for now.
