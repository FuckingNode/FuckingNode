# Installer scripts

Here you'll find Windows `.ps1` and macOS/Linux `.sh` installers for FuckingNode. These scripts will download the executable and add it to `PATH`, **plus create a bunch of `.ps1`/`.sh` shorthand files**.

When running `deno task good` they'll get copied to the docsite (if cloned in `fkdocs/`) so they're available from the root of the website for running. You should edit them from here and not the docsite repository.
