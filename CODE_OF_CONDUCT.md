# Code Of Conduct

Ironically, the last thing we want for the F\*ckingNode project is people that happens to be ~~f\*cking~~ stupid.

Thankfully, not being f- stupid is as simple as being respectful and sensible. And we're really thankful to tell you'll probably abide by such a simple rule :smile:.
