## Chores (should do)

- [ ] Better error handling.
  - [x] Throw all errors and handle them from the main loop (except of course for catch statements that don't crash AKA allow the CLI to keep doing stuff).
  - [ ] Add error codes for all errors.
  - [x] Make error messages consistent.
- [x] Better help.
  - [x] Make invalid input errors show hints to help the user.
- [x] Cleanup the codebase (it's getting kinda messy ngl).

## Ideas (want to do)

- [ ] macOS and Linux install scripts.
- [ ] Actually write some f\*cking tests.

## Trivia stuff (might do)

- [ ] Add more `ColorString()` options and use them in more places.
- [x] Add an about command.

  - [x] NODE
  - [ ] DENO
  - [ ] BUN

  - [x] NODE
  - [x] DENO
