# F\*ckingNode Security Policy

Keeping software secure can be a f\*cking headache. While this CLI tool might look like a simple automating tool, it ships to production with access to filesystem read and write, environment variable access, networking access, command execution access, and system information access, so **security is actually important**.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, you should do one of the following:

- If you simply found what can be considered a SECURITY issue, contact us privately through [Discord](https://discord.com/users/807903704472223754). We'll work on a patch and release it as soon as possible.
- If you found an issue AND you know how and want to fix it yourself - first, thank you! - and second, contact us with the fix rather than making a public fork and a public PR. Security issues must be kept secret to avoid exploiting. You will be acknowledged as a contributor for your help, don't worry.

### Supported Versions

This section is here for redundancy, as this isn't some large-scale project with "v20" and "v19" being both supported. As soon as v3 comes out, v2 drops support. The latest major (as we use SemVer) defines whether a version is supported or not. Period.
