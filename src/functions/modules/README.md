# IGNORE THIS

This folder holds the **FuckingNode Instruction Modules & Extension Modules** system.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is very, VERY, _**VERY**_ unfinished and experimental and not ready and whatever. **Do not touch or use this until I remove this warning. I've made them public for transparency (and to hype the next major a little bit), but they're not expected to work, to have good code, or to be ready within the next few months. This won't be available as a feature until the next major release.

This is code that I haven't touched in a while, it's not good, not finished, not anything. Give it some time, a lot of time, and I'll hopefully have something that works.

> FYI, Instruction Modules are like language/runtime support packs and Extension Modules are, you guessed it, extensions.

Note: Sometimes they're called modules (more logical name) and sometimes they're called "nodes". Calling them Nodes is less clear, but fits in way better by giving back a meaning to "FuckingNode", which supporting Rust doesn't make that much sense of a name now. Final name remains undecided, despite this README using "modules".
