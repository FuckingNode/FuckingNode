## Chores and trivial tasks

- [ ] Rewrite audit to use JSON instead of raw strings (should've done this before...)
- [ ] Add error codes for all errors.
- [ ] Cleanup the codebase (it's getting kinda messy ngl).
- [ ] [ ] Follow my own f\*cking guidelines, there are different ways of coding mixed up in the same project :skull: (this means updating old code to match `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
- [ ] ~~Actually write some f\*cking tests.~~ (not happening)
