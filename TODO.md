# Tasks

> [!TIP]
> These are all things I want to do. Most tasks are major-release oriented, as patches just fix bugs and minors just bring in random improvements that come to my mind - or at least that's the idea.

## Cmds

- [ ] Calls to FKN, so that you can directly invoke, idk, destroy, or clean, or we could even pack some cmd-specific features into the CLI.
- [ ] Allow to use `--flags` to conditionally execute different scripts in Cmds.

## Setups

### Features

- [ ] Add advanced templating. This is, prompts and questions to autofill a template
  - [ ] fknode.yaml and prettier ones
  - [ ] vercel.json, eslint conf, gatsby conf, etc...

## Chores & development

- [ ] **Actually write some (more) fucking tests.** TDD is the best way to go.
- [ ] Cleanup the codebase (it's getting kinda messy ngl), and review all code to follow my own fucking guidelines, there are different ways of coding mixed up in the same project :skull: (this means updating old code to match `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
